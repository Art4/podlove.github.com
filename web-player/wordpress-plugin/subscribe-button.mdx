## Podcast Services

Most of the podcast clients will use the RSS Feed in order to subscribe to your podcast. In the last few years there has been a trend for clients making use of their own registry to manage their subscriptions. Clients that need further configuration are highlighted in green while clients that use the RSS feed are marked in blue.

Sometimes it is hard to figure out every possible service ID. You can use services like [pod.link](https://pod.link/) to get easy access to all platforms that distribute your podcast.
