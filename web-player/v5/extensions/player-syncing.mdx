Sometimes it multiple players are present on a single page. Since each sandboxed instance doesn't know about other players it is possible to play multiple episodes at the same time. This behaviour can be orchestrated:

  class="codesandbox"
  title="Syncing Plugin Playground"
  style={{width: '100%', border: 'none', height: '600px'}}
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>
