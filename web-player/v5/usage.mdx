/*
 *   Podlove Player Factory
 *   @param {string, dom node}   selector        - CSS selector or dom node
 *   @param {string, object}     episode         - Path to JSON episode or episode object
 *   @param {string, object}     configuration   - Path to JSON config or configuration object
 *   @returns {Promise}          store           - Promise returning a redux store
 */

window
  .podlovePlayer("#app", "episode.json", "config.json")
  .then(store => {
    store.subscribe(() => {
      console.log(store.getState());
    });
  });
```

### Signature

- Selector can be a css selector or a dom node reference
- An iframe as the canvas is injected into the reference, encapsulating the player
- Configuration can be provided as a meta object or an url to the configuration json file
- Canvas width can be defined by the template
- Canvas height is adapted to players height


Using a selector that matches multiple elements the player will be rendered in the first matching element.
The _podlovePlayer_ returns a promise with a redux store as a result that can be used to change the player state from outside.
