title: "Episode Images"
---

Every podcast has a cover image. However, if you like, you can set a custom image per episode as well. You can set episode images for some episodes or all. Whenever an episode image is not available, the podcast cover is used.

## Getting Started

The main setting you need is `Podlove > Episode Assets > Assign Assets > Episode Image`.

The options are:

- **Use Podcast Cover**: Always use the podcast cover as episode image. This is the default.
- **Post Thumbnail**: Use the WordPress "featured image" as episode image.
- **Manual URL entry per Episode**: Adds a URL field to episode forms where you can manually insert the URL to an image.
- **Assets**: If you define an image asset (png or jpg) you can choose it here.
